Hey there! I'm Bhavdeep Singh Sachdeva - a Software Engineer at AWS GuardDuty who loves building AI systems and writing about the future of artificial intelligence.

**Live site:** https://bhavdeep98.github.io

## What's This About?

This is my corner of the internet where I share:
- Research papers I've published (ACL, EACL, and friends)
- Thoughts on AI safety, governance, and multi-agent systems
- My journey from academia to AWS
- Random musings about technology and life

Think of it as my digital business card, but way cooler.
