                        I am a Ph.D. candidate and researcher with a deep passion for advancing the field of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP). My work focuses on addressing the limitations of current AI systems in areas such as robustness, generalization, and ethical impact. Through projects involving benchmark development, data quality improvement, and efficient training strategies, I aim to create AI models that are not only technically advanced but also socially responsible.

                        <br />
Currently working at AWS GuardDuty, I bring over six years of industry experience and three years of research to my work, where I explore cutting-edge solutions in machine learning, threat detection, and adaptive problem-solving. I invite you to explore my research projects, publications, and my latest proposal, which focuses on evolving large language models through social interaction to simulate human-like intelligence in dynamic, multi-agent environments.
