                        I am a Software Development Engineer at Amazon,
                        Amazon Web Services team, where I have led the
                        delivery of scalable, secure solutions from concept
                        to market. My expertise bridges the gap between
                        technical engineering excellence and strategic
                        business impact, ensuring product developments drive
                        substantial business value. Deeply invested in AI
                        research, Iâ€™ve scrutinized the robustness and
                        generalization of large language models, focusing on
                        data quality and the identification of biases within
                        NLP. Eager to explore the integration of theory of
                        mind into AI, I am committed to pioneering systems
                        that are ethically responsible, environmentally
                        sustainable, and inherently fair.
